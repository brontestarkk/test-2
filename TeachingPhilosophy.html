												<h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>

											<h3>My Journey to Becoming a Teacher</h3>
											<p>I began my educational journey in 2008. I started school 1 year earlier than most children, but I believed it pushed me to become more mature and hardworking at an earlier age. Overall, throughout my 13 years of schooling I loved every second and miss it today.</p>

											<p>I went to two different primary schools starting at Mowbray Public where I completed Kindergarten and half of year 1. As my parents were building a house in the shire I then moved to Como West public school where I finished year 1 and continued until year 6. I have a limited memory of my time at Mowbray Public school but can remember teachers and initiatives in place at Como West.</p>

											<p>From a young age I really enjoyed helping people especially if I had to teach them topics like  maths, even though I’m not the best. I liked taking responsibility and leadership which I think also stemmed from me being the eldest in my family. Como West allowed me to participate in SRC, a class representative program as well as peer support, where the older students would help younger students complete activities.</p> 
										
											<p>Como West was a primary school that focused heavily on bullying in the school environment which was very limited. They also ensured that students lived up to the 4 main traits of care, respect, responsibility and kindness. These 4 factors were really heavily implemented in our school life, which I think was really beneficial as all those traits are needed in the future and lead to success. If a student showed these traits in the school environment the teacher or fellow peers could nominate them for an award. I think this award system was a really great way of acknowledging a child’s actions and praising them for good behaviour.</p>

											<p>My year 4 teacher Mr Allen was someone who I looked up to. He had this way of teaching where he made everything engaging. For our spelling lessons he gave us the opportunity to choose how we wanted to learn our words. An example is writing the words on the window, but backwards so people on the outside could understand the word. By allowing students to choose how they wanted to learn meant they could take their time and find a way that was most beneficial to them. Mr Allen also had a great sense of humor which created his closer bond with students. He would light up students' day by joking around but also having that balance of discipline which I also think is essential.</p> 
											
											<p>Throughout year 5 and 6 I became a very anxious child. The tiniest things would worry me which made it very hard for me to stay calm and positive. I had the same teacher over these two years, Mr Bridgeland. He really ensured he looked after me by asking if I was okay and reassuring me when I was in doubt. I think teaching the child is obviously the most important thing about being a teacher but also checking up on them and focusing on their feelings can really benefit the child.
												</p>

											<p> When I got to high school my passion was visual arts and textiles. It wasn’t till year 7 when I realised I was more of a visual learner. These creative subjects also became an outlet for me.</p>
											
											<p>I knew from a younger age I wanted to be a teacher, but from really enjoying textiles and visuals arts I instantly knew I wanted to be a Design Technology teacher.</p>
												
											<p>For my year 11 and 12 schooling I went to De La Salle Catholic College Cronulla. These were some of the best years of my life and I will never forget my time at school. I really enjoyed going to school for both the educational and social aspect. All my teachers were amazing and played an active role in constructing my views about education.</p>
											
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/grad.JPG" alt="" /></span>

											<p>My design technology teacher, Miss Gamasaragan, was truly the best. She had this way of teaching that made every lesson so engaging. I remember our first lesson she was explaining to us how she needed learning support and struggled throughout school. But with the help of her teachers and her motivation she was able to achieve really highly. By starting our first lesson of the year it showed her students that no matter their difficulties she would help us all as much as we needed. Miss Gamasaragan would put in an equal amount of effort with all students and push them to reach their potential especially for their HSC majors. 
												Miss Gamasaragan used a range of teaching styles in her class. An example is open discussion allowing everyone to have a say in bouncing ideas off each other. She also would show short relevant clips based on what we were learning. I think by making the lessons relevant also helped me personally relate my class back to current situations and remember them easily. She was the main reason I stuck by my idea of becoming a teacher. 
												</p>
												
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/miss gam.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>Throughout my schooling I had 3 teachers who really helped and inspired me. Their passion for teaching and how they cared so much about each individual student not only helped me but other students feel valued. They were able to have the perfect balance of friendship, leadership, discipline and knowledge that made every student feel comfortable asking for help with work or school life.</p> 	
											
											<p> So where am I now? I am currently fulfilling my dream of becoming a design technology teacher at university. It is constantly testing my knowledge but pushing me to think harder about why I actually want to be a teacher.
