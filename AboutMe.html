												<p>About me, get to known me!</p>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"></p><img src="images/ME.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>My name is Bronte Stark and I am currently 21 years old. I have three different jobs including working at RipCurl, a retail surf shop, a cafe and catering being a waitress for parties and cocktail event. On top of that I am also at university full time. I got to Australian Catholic University and study a Bachelor of Education, Secondary and a Bachelor of the Arts, Design Technology.</p>

											<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
											<p>When I'm not working or at university I like to spend my time at the beach. I love the beach and have grown up around it. Swimming is my favourite past time. I also enjoy cooking. I love cooking any type of desert like brownies, rocky road or cupcakes. I have a sweet tooth and love anything chocolate.</p>

											<h4>My University Journey</h4>
											<p>My journey at university has been a rollercoaster ride. It has pushed my outside of my comfort zone and taught my a range o fnew and interesting skills. I have really enjoyed the education subjects, especially regarding inclusive education. I think it is extremely important that all indivdiuals are included, feel safe in the classroom environment and have learning catered to their needs. My major for Design Technology unit is Textiles Technology with a minor in Food Technology. Sewing has been a passion of mine since Year 7 and I love the idea of teaching other individuals how to do it. </p>
											<p>University has allowed me to make some of my closest friends that will be in my life forever. These friends are completing the same course as me, meaning I have support throughout my whole university journey. My friends include Elle, Bianca, Hugh, Max and Clare and we met in 2020 the first year of University. I can not wait to graduate with my friends and become a full time teacher which has been a dream of mine.</p>
